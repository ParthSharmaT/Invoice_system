### Getting Started

### Fork, clone locally & create a branch

Fork [Invoice System](https://github.com/ParthSharmaT/Invoice_system) repository and clone at your local

- Fork and Clone the repo using

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ParthSharmaT/Invoice_system.git
```

### Setting Environment First Time

#### Basic Requirements

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

#### Creating [Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

A virtual environment is a tool that helps keep dependencies required and the project isolated. If you wish to install a new library and write

```
pip install name_of_library
```

on the terminal without activating an environment, all the packages will be installed globally which is not a good practice if youâ€™re working with different projects on your computer.

If this sounds a bit complicated, donâ€™t worry so much because a virtual environment is just a directory that will contain all the necessary files for our project to run.

**Installing venv (required once)**

**Windows**

```
py -m pip install --user virtualenv
py -m venv env
```

**Linux**

```
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
python3 -m venv env
```

You have to start virtual environment everytime you start new terminal -

**Windows**

Using gitbash

```
. env/Scripts/activate
```

Using Powershell

```
. env\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux**

```
source env/bin/activate
```

#### Installing Requirements

**Windows**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Linux**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Migrating Database

**Windows**

```
py manage.py migrate
```

**Linux**

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

#### Create Superuser

**Windows**

```
py manage.py createsupeser
```

**Linux**

```
python3 manage.py createsupeser
```

### Starting Development Server

**Windows**

```
py manage.py runserver
```

**Linux**

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

### Leaving the virtual environment

```
deactivate
```

### Update requirements file (Critical)

If you have installed new dependency, the pip freeze command lists the third-party packages and versions installed in the environment.

**Windows**

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

**Linux**

```
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Update Database

Everytime you change db models, you need to run makemigrations and migrate to update on database.

**Windows**

```
py manage.py makemigrations
py manage.py migrate
```

**Linux**

```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
